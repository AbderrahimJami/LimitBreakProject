# 🎮 [LimitBreak]() Mentorship Program

## Unreal Engine Horror Game Prototype

This is an ongoing Unreal Engine 5 horror game project I'm building as a portfolio piece. The focus is on solidifying game programming fundamentals, applying design patterns, and maintaining clean coding practices. It began as part of a mentorship program I joined last year.


>This is a collaborative project made possible thanks to the supervision of [_**Dmitry Galenko**_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrygalenko/) as part of the [**_LimitBreak Mentorship program_**](https://www.limitbreak.co.uk/).

## 🧱 Project Focus

- **Game Programming Patterns:** State machines, component-driven design, Event-Driven Gameplay, modular AI, OOP Principles.
- **Code Quality:** Emphasis on readable, maintainable code with consistent standards.
- **Version Control using Git and Fork** Feature branches are used to keep development organized and traceable.

## 🌿 Active Branches (at time of writing)

| Branch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `main` | 🚩 Default branch. Stable base for merging completed features. |
| `core/Player-FSM` | Core state machine logic for player character behavior. |
| `feature/animation-system` | Working on animation blueprint integration and system modularity. |
| `feature/enemy/ai-behavior` | Implementing enemy decision-making and perception systems. |
| `feature/enemy/base-setup` | Basic enemy actor structure, movement, and detection groundwork. |
| `greyboxing/guest-house` | Level greyboxing for an early playable environment using the Prologue in Resident Evil 7 as a base(guest house area). |
| `health` | Health component logic — shared between player and enemies. |

> ⚠️ More branches may be added or cleaned up as the project evolves.

## 🛠️ Development Philosophy

- **Feature Isolation:** All new functionality lives in its own branch until it's review-ready.
- **Clean Commits:** Strive for atomic commits and informative messages.
- **Learning-Oriented:** This is a hands-on space to test, break, and improve game systems.
