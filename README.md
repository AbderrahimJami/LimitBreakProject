## 📖 About

The project revolved around recreating some of the gameplay mechanics around one of my favourite games of the last generation: [***Resident Evil 7***](https://youtu.be/rxjOFd0YNo0?si=MagHtZ3Wl6_uJcRF). 
This project is intended as a portfolio piece to demonstrate Unreal Engine skills, including Blueprint/C++ integration, gameplay systems, and user interface design.
